*REPORT*
- Analyze compact EVs and hybrid SUVs under $45,000:
  *“I have a 2020 Subaru Crosstrek and a really tight garage—any new car can't be more than about 20 percent bigger in length, width, or height. Please look at every 2022-or-newer EV or plug-in hybrid crossover/SUV sold in the U.S. that fits that size. For each one, list its dimensions and key specs (range or MPG/MPGe, charge times, etc.), and then approximate five-year ownership costs. Summarize the main pros and cons—performance, reliability, safety scores, tech, cargo room, charging access, resale outlook, warranty—and spell out how EV and PHEV running costs and incentives compare.”*

- Research fundamentals of natural wine vs. traditional techniques (autonomous trucking insurance example):
  *“Produce a comprehensive research report on the rise of autonomous highway trucking and its implications for the auto insurance industry … Include scenario analysis reflecting potential geopolitical disruptions … Support the report with charts, forecasts, and comparative tables.”*

*ACTION SUMMARY*

  *“I was unexpectedly out of the office last week for a family emergency. Can you do a review of my Teams account and bring me up to speed on the latest updates I should know and who I should prioritize getting back to first?”*
